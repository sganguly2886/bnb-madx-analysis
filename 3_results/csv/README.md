# Final CSV Results — BNB Optics Scans

This directory contains **final numerical results** derived from MAD-X
simulations and wire-chamber measurements for the BNB narrow beam optics
studies (Q873, Q874, Q875 scans).

All CSVs here are **post-processed analysis products** suitable for:
- plotting,
- comparison studies,
- archival reference.

Raw MAD-X TFS files are intentionally **not stored** in this repository.

## Reproducibility

All CSVs are generated by scripts in:

2_python/


using TFS optics files from:1_twiss_outputs/

The analysis is fully reproducible from source.
