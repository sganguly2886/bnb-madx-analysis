# External Raw Beamline Data (Not Tracked)

This directory is intentionally empty.

Place raw BNB beam study CSV files here if you have access, for example:

- bnb_br_study_2025-06-16/

These raw data files are NOT included in this repository because:
- They are large
- They may be access-controlled
- They are not suitable for version control

All analysis scripts in `2_python/` accept a `--data-dir` argument
to point to this directory.
